# Objective: To practice basic arithmetic operations in Python by performing predefined calculations.

number1 = 10
number2 = 5
result_add = number1 + number2
print(f"Addition of {number1} and {number2} is {result_add} ")

result_substr = number1 - number2
print(f"Substraction of {number1} and {number2} is {result_substr} ")

result_times = number1 * number2
print(f"Substraction of {number1} and {number2} is {result_times} ")
